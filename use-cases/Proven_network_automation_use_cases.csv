Use Case,Category,Business Value
Configuration Compliance Monitoring,Configuration Management,"Continuously validates network devices against company configuration standards, preventing security gaps and policy violations"
Static Configuration Deployment at Scale,Configuration Management,"Rapidly deploys standardized configurations across thousands of devices. 
Achievement: Deployed 30,000 TACACS configs across 7,000+ devices in 35 minutes"
Dynamic Interface Documentation,Configuration Management,"Automatically modifies device configurations based on discovered network context and peer information 
(e.g., tagging wireless controller uplinks with '#wireless', updating QoS policies based on device type)"
Link Quality Telemetry Analysis,Health & Monitoring,"Monitors interface errors, CRC, duplex mismatches, and speed degradation to detect performance issues before they impact users"
Automated Link Connectivity Testing,Health & Monitoring,Executes ping tests across all network links on target devices to validate end-to-end connectivity and identify silent failures
Link Stability & Flapping Detection,Health & Monitoring,"Identifies unstable network links with excessive flap counts, enabling proactive replacement before outages occur"
Device Reload Risk Assessment,Health & Monitoring,Flags devices with extremely high uptimes that may be running outdated code or harboring memory leaks requiring maintenance windows
Debug State Detection & Remediation,Health & Monitoring,Identifies devices running resource-intensive debug commands and automatically disables them to prevent performance degradation
Unsaved Configuration Detection,Health & Monitoring,"Discovers devices with uncommitted configuration changes and either saves or alerts, preventing configuration loss during unexpected reboots"
Media Type Mismatch Detection,Health & Monitoring,"Discovers fiber optic media mismatches between link endpoints (e.g., SX vs LX) that cause intermittent connectivity issues"
OSPF Interface Type Validation,Health & Monitoring,Detects OSPF interface type mismatches (broadcast vs point-to-point) that prevent neighbor relationships from forming
Self-Loopback Detection,Health & Monitoring,"Identifies ports accidentally wired back to the same device, typically from cabling errors during installation"
Port-Channel Redundancy Audit,Resilience & Redundancy,"Detects port-channels operating with only one active member, eliminating the redundancy they were designed to provide"
Single-Homed Device Discovery,Resilience & Redundancy,"Identifies network devices lacking redundant uplinks, highlighting single points of failure in the infrastructure"
Wireless AP Controller Redundancy Check,Resilience & Redundancy,"Finds wireless access points connected to only one controller, creating availability risks during controller maintenance"
Wireless Client Distribution Analysis,Intelligence & Analytics,"Tracks wireless client counts over time across all APs to optimize capacity and detect overloaded cells, 
surpassing Cisco DNA’s single-AP client visibility with network-wide historical insights."
Routing Table Intelligence & Analysis,Intelligence & Analytics,"Parses global routing and BGP tables to validate route propagation, detect suboptimal paths, and identify routing anomalies"
Enhanced Traceroute Tool,Intelligence & Analytics,"Performs advanced traceroute from Linux or Cisco devices, enriched with IP database and DNS lookups for better path visualization"
Comprehensive Device Reachability Checker,Intelligence & Analytics,"Uses multi-protocol testing suite to determine actual device status, even when behind firewalls or with ICMP blocked"
