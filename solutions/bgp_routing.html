						The primary goal of this is to assess changes in the routing paths.
						This is achieved by comparing the outputs of the 'sh ip bgp' command at different time intervals.
						Additionally, the script's secondary purpose is to create concise yet thorough routing documentation 
						company's network. It aims to detail the routing configurations for over 6,000 networks, ensuring 
						an updated and accessible reference for efficient network management and troubleshooting.

						Networks may originate from one or more Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs). 
						Each ASN is typically associated with a specific geographical region, indicating that a network's origin 
						can span multiple regions. The automation facilitates the detection of routing changes by examining 
						alterations in the list of ASNs or their associated regions. A significant change, such as a complete lack
						of common ASNs/regions between two time periods, suggests a total change in the routing path of a network.
